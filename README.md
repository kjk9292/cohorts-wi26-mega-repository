# Bookmark Manager

A collaborative open-source project for learning full-stack development. Built by cohort students, one week at a time.

## What We're Building

A bookmark manager that lets you save, organize, and search your favorite links. Think of it as building your own mini Pocket or Raindrop.io.

## Tech Stack (Progressive)

| Week | Technology | Focus |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1 | HTML + CSS | Static UI, layout, styling |
| 2 | Vanilla JavaScript | DOM manipulation, local storage |
| 3 | React | Components, props, state |
| 4 | React Hooks | useEffect, custom hooks, context |
| 5 | Node.js + Express | REST API, backend fundamentals |
| 6 | MongoDB | Database, schemas, CRUD |
| 7 | Deployment | CI/CD, testing, going live |
